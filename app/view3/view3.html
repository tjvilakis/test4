        <h1>About</h1>
        <p>TurboTwo is a purely academic, 'internet heritage' pursuit which provides extended functionality to
         the ages old text-based MMORPG game <a href="http://www.mudcentral.com" target="_blank">MajorMud</a> by automating
        and centralizing cross-server information such as game server status, top lists, and other playing metrics.</p>
        <p>TurboTwo.net came about as a university computer science project, but was a long time in the making.
        Several years ago, the site TurboSentry.net went down after the long time Sysop of the
        EntConn BBS passed away [<a href="http://turbosentry.org/" target="_blank">it is back up</a> now thanks to Turbofoot!].

        <p>TurboTwo.net is written in <b>AngularJS</b> for the front end,
        <b>Python</b> for the Telnet crawling service which stores the Top100 list
        data from each board in <b>JSON</b> format on a <b>mongodb</b>.
        The logo is poorly made by me.  If you don't like it,
        make me a new one please.</p>
        <p>The entire stack is stored in the cloud on a <b>Bitnami MEAN</b> <i>(Mongo, Express, Angular, Node)</i>
        stack on a "free" EC2 virtual Linux server running on Amazon Web Services.</p>

        <p class="small">I do not have enough good things to say about Python.</p></center>

        <p>I have desires, not necessarily plans though, to eventually make a web-based .dat viewer,
            and what really excites me is the idea of making a 3D WebGL Map explorer which is similar to what
            you would find in MM Explorer but entirely web based using something like the Cesium library or similar.
        I guess the best I can describe my vision for that is the map created by the drones in the movie Prometheus.</p>
        <p>So, thank you for visiting.  If you have any comments or questions please feel free to contact me.
        I feel it important to keep the legacy/heritage elements of the old WWW alive and I hope that since you
        are reading this, you can identify with that cause.</p>
