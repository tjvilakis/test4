        <h1>About</h1>
        <p>TurboTwo.net came about as a university computer science project, but was a long time in the making.
        Several years ago, the site TurboSentry.net went down after the long time Sysop of the
        EntConn BBS's passed away [<a href="http://turbosentry.org/">it is back up</a> now thanks to Turbo Foot].  At the time I was still on active
        duty in the military and did not really have the time or knowledge to re-create or work on any MajorMud
        related projects.
        Fast forward to 2016, and I am finishing my Masters of CS at National University in San Diego
        and decided to write a new Telnet Crawler, to give myself a little more exposure to some technologies
        that I wasn't all that familiar with.</p>
        <p>TurboTwo.net is written in Python for the Telnet crawling service which stores the Top10 list
        data from each board in JSON format on a MongoDB.  The website you are looking at is written in
        Angular JS using Bootstrap CSS styling.  The logo is poorly made by me.  If you don't like it,
        make me a new one please.</p>
        <p>The entire stack is stored in the cloud on a Bitnami MEAN (Mongo, Express, Angular, Node)
        stack on a "free" EC2 Linux server.</p>

        <p>I have plans to eventually make an online .dat viewer, and what really excites me is the
        idea of making a 3D WebGL map which is similar to what you would find in MM Explorer but is
        web based.</p>
        <p>If you have any comments, suggestions, or ideas please email the contact listed in the nav bar
        above.  Thanks for visiting the site!  Happy Mudding. </p>
