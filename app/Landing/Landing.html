        <p>Updates</p>

    <p>9/17/2016 7:30pm - Ran into issues with CORS and cross site header stuff, overcame issue after 6 hours on SO.
    The site now successfully, using Angular JS uses an Angular controller to access an API hosted on this
    same server in order to do a RESTful GET of dynamic Top100 lists from game servers stored on the mongodb.
    This brings the project's major aim to fruiting.  All major technical barries have been addressed.  The
    only things left are content and display cleanup on the GUI and minor back end tweaks.</p>
