        <h1>Welcome to TurboTwo</h1>
        <h2>Updates</h2>

    <p><b>9/19/2016 8:04pm</b> - Pretty furious right now that simple href download=x type of html links to files for
    download within the Angular app require controllers and all kinds of nonsense.  What used to be the easiest
    thing ever, to link to a download file on your site is now practically a 20 step process in Angula at least
        on a Bitnami AWS server.  Not happy about that.</p><p><b>Update:</b> Much to the chagrin of trolls on
        Stack Overflow, I figured out an easier way to do this.  Edit the Apache2 httpd.conf file to add an
        Alias /downloads /{project path}/downloads and then point your href at the full or partial URL path of the file ie.
        http://www.turbotwo.net/downloads/file or /downloads/file like such:</p>
            <ul><li>
                <a target="_blank" href="http://www.turbotwo.net/downloads/MegaMUD_v1.03u.zip">This</a> works.
            </li>
            <li>
                <a target="_blank" href="downloads/MegaMUD_v1.03u.zip">This</a> also works.
            </li></ul>

    <p><b>9/19/2016 7:00pm</b> - <b>Proof of concept complete!</b>  Automatic python script logs in to game server
    Entconn2.com and pulls top 100 list, post lists to mongodb.  Front end running Angular can access Express.js
    API on this server, pull the data in JSON format from the mongodb and display it.  Some notes:
    <ul>
            <li>Still need to further dissect the data further for display in a better table and do metrics</li>
            <li>It's worth noting that a standard Python Dictionary-data type was not sufficient and an OrderedDict collection was required</li>
        </ul>
    </p>
            <hr/>

    <p><b>9/18/2016 6:01pm</b> - Wrapping up the formatting of the telnet top 100 data into manageable JSON data today
    and tomorrow.  Also of note, after some analysis on the Py telnet crawler script, I noted that:
    <ul><li>I need to
    include handling for the condition that the script does NOT connect, allow the DB to keep the existing top list
    data, and pass another JSON keypair/element indicating successful or unsuccessful connections to the game servers.
   </li> </ul></p>
             <hr/>

    <p><b>9/17/2016 7:30pm</b> - Ran into issues with CORS and cross site header stuff, overcame issue after 6 hours on SO.
    The site now successfully, using Angular JS uses an Angular controller to access an API hosted on this
    same server in order to do a RESTful GET of dynamic Top100 lists from game servers stored on the mongodb.
    This brings the project's major aim to fruiting.  All major technical barries have been addressed.  The
    only things left are content and display cleanup on the GUI and minor back end tweaks, mostly:
    <ul>
        <li>Sort the Top Lists either serverside or client side after AJAX call and put them in a table</li>
        <li>Cleanup CSS</li>
        <li>Test python script with other servers</li>
        <li>Downloads</li>
        </ul></p>
        <hr/>

    <p><b>9/3/2016 6:01pm</b> - Telnet Crawler completed, written in Python on the MEAN stack on EC2 Amazon Web Services.
    The crawler successfully polls remote MajorMud game servers, grabs the Top 100 list after interrogating the
    login process and parses the buffer for actual Top 100 user information.  This is then scrubbed of ASCII
    markup and posted to mongodb.</p>
        <hr/>

    <p><b>8/21/2016 6:01pm</b> - Work on Telnet Crawler continues.  Bootstrap CSS selected for front end UI.
    Blocking issue with the python crawler, the python telnet lib seems to not play nice with suppress go ahead
    signals on a telnet connection.  Switched to socket lib and I can negotiate the connection.</p>
        <hr/>

    <p><b>8/7/2016 8:44pm</b> - Dev environment set up, Bitnami Linux MEAN stack running on Amazon Web Services (AWS)
    EC2.  Github repo set up.  Angular Seed web shell configured in WebStorm on dev laptop, pushed successfully
    to Github.  Git pull success, website online.  Using a command similar to "screen -d -m httpd" to persist
    the web server after Putty ssh connection to server is closed.  </p>
        <hr/>

    <p><b>7/22/2016 9:03am</b> - Project design documents created and submitted to NU.  The TurboTwo project will use AngularJS, MongoDB,
    and Python to pull data off MajorMud game servers in an automated fashion, where the Angular web UI will
    display them per game server.</p>
