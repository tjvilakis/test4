        <p>Updates</p>

    <p>9/17/2016 7:30pm - Ran into issues with CORS and cross site header stuff, overcame issue after 6 hours on SO.
    The site now successfully, using Angular JS uses an Angular controller to access an API hosted on this
    same server in order to do a RESTful GET of dynamic Top100 lists from game servers stored on the mongodb.
    This brings the project's major aim to fruiting.  All major technical barries have been addressed.  The
    only things left are content and display cleanup on the GUI and minor back end tweaks.</p>

    <p>9/3/2016 6:01pm - Telnet Crawler completed, written in Python on the MEAN stack on EC2 Amazon Web Services.
    The crawler successfully polls remote MajorMud game servers, grabs the Top 100 list after interrogating the
    login process and parses the buffer for actual Top 100 user information.  This is then scrubbed of ASCII
    markup and posted to mongodb.</p>

    <p>7/22/2016 9:03am - Project design documents created and submitted to NU.  The TurboTwo project will use AngularJS, MongoDB,
    and Python to pull data off MajorMud game servers in an automated fashion, where the Angular web UI will
    display them per game server.</p>
